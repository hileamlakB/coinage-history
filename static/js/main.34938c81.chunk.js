In fact, bronze was still the major currency as silver and gold were scarce. The bronze aes signatum bars had evolved into circular cast aes grave, which are considered as one of the first bronze Roman coins. These were large and heavy, and served mostly as a means of standardizing the measurement and transfer of bronze metal. The denominations of aes grave were based on the as, a Roman pound (~324 g). Each as was worth 12 ounces (unciae), and intermediate denominations such as semis (six unciae), triens (four unciae), quadrans (three unciae) and sextans (two unciae) were also produced.\n\nThis as is significantly undersized, weighing in at only 262.5 grams. Though the first aes grave minted in 290 BCE were full-sized and obeyed the libral standard, later issues suffered from inflation due to the First and Second Punic Wars. The reduced libral standard was introduced in 270 BCE at 274 grams (10 unciae) per as, and this is closest to the weight of this example. Shortly after this coin was minted, the standard dropped again to the semilibral standard, meaning that one as was only 137 grams (6 unciae). The weight standard would continue to drop until 91 BCE, well into the late Republic. As all the successive sub-as denominations also dropped in weight and adopted more manageable sizes, they heralded a new stage of minting in which coins were struck rather than cast. Denominational marks, such as the vertical line on the obverse and reverse of this coin, also became necessary to indicate the value of each coin, which was no longer its intrinsic metal value.\n\nThe design of the as was fairly standardized, with a janiform head on the obverse and a ship's prow on the reverse.

This brought them into conflict with the tow of Saguntum, which was allied with the Romans. Hungry for revenge, the Carthaginians jumped at the chance to fight Rome again, this time led by the brothers Hasdrubal and Hannibal. Despite Rome's aggressive plans to attack the Carthaginians in both Spain and Africa, Hannibal's tactic of marching straight into Italy itself surprised the Romans and in a few short years was able to erode much of the Roman federation. A series of crushing defeats suffered by the Romans (who at one point appointed two dictators out of desperation) culminated in the Battle of Cannae, in which 35,000 out of the 50,000-strong Roman army were killed or captured. Finally, Rome recovered Syracuse and Capua, strategically important cities in Sicily and on the Italian mainland, respectively. In an all-out effort to end the war in Spain, 24 year-old Publius Cornelius Scipio (son of the eponymous general who fell in battle against Hasdrubal) was appointed to command the Roman forces. After the capture of New Carthage and thus the effective end of the war in Spain, the Romans saw Hasdrubal march to Italy to assist his brother, whose forces were in need of support. Fortunately for Rome, Hasdrubal's forces were intercepted in Northern Italy and destroyed. In the last chapter of the war, Scipio brought his forces to successfullly invade Carthaginian territory in Africa itself. This finally brought peace, with Carthage reduced to a shadow of its former glory.\n\nDespite its victory, Rome was almost financially ruined by this war. With much of the male population off to battle, Roman agriculture suffered greatly. A reserve fund from the treasury was tapped into for the first time in thirty years. Severe shortages of silver brought about the debasement of the silver didrachms, and the first gold coins (aurei and quinaarii) were minted for use in high-value transactions. The weight standard of the bronze as was repeatedly reduced. In around 212 BCE, Rome created a new silver currency system based on the denarius, valued at 10 asses. Thus the Romans gradually weaned off of the Greek didrachms and established a new standard which would last for over 400 years.",References:"Harl, K. W. (1996).

The Sempronii were a prominent Roman family who occupied positions such as the consulship in the early Republic. L. Sempronius Pitio was one example of a Roman moneyer, a private citizen given the authority to mint coinage, and his role reflected the need for the Republic to quickly expand its coinage to meet the financial necessities of war.\n\nRome's transition to a monetized economy was finally complete, with vast reserves of wealth acquired from its foreign conquests. Countless gold and silver coins from Sicily, Carthage, and Rome's enemies on the Italian peninsula were melted and re-coined, meaning that the denarii such as this one became the dominant form of currency in the region. The Roman population had also learned to accept and use coins for their transactions, with so many men having served in the military and received the new denarii as wages. In contrast with the Greeks, Rome did not need large silver denominations such as the tetradrachm, and the minting of gold coins was largely restricted to times of financial emergency. Therefore its bimetallic (silver and bronze) currency system was ideally designed for small domestic transactions, and quickly entered the everyday lives of Mediterraneans.",References:"Harvard Art Museums, Asian and Mediterranean Art, 1954.70.3\n\nCoppola, B.
